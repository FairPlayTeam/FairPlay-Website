# FairPlay - Where Creativity Stays Human

**FairPlay** is a free, open-source streaming platform that puts *people* back at the heart of online creativity.

## Our mission?

The internet is increasingly filled with bots, AI-generated content, and algorithmic noise.  
FairPlay was created to reclaim the human side of creativity — a place where real skills, passions, and stories can thrive.

> “Your passions deserve more than an algorithm.”
