# FairPlay - Where Creativity Stays Human

**FairPlay** is a free, open-source streaming platform that puts _people_ back at the heart of online creativity.  
No algorithms, no ads, no distractions - just meaningful videos, community engagement, and open collaboration.

**Find us at** [our website](https://fairplay.video)

## Our Mission

The internet is increasingly filled with bots, AI-generated content, and algorithmic noise. FairPlay was created to reclaim the human side of creativity — a place where real skills, passions, and stories can thrive.

> “Your passions deserve more than an algorithm.”

---

FairPlay is currently under development. You'll be introduced to the user interface and some features, but please note that the project is still under development.

This is the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) version of the FairPlay website. It currently includes the landing page. More features will be implemented soon.

## Open Source

FairPlay is an open source project, and we're always looking for contributors to make the internet a better place. To learn how to contribute, visit the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/FairPlayTeam/FairPlay-Website/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Community

FairPlay is built by a community of developers who believe the internet should stay **human**. You can be a part of our community by joining the discussion on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ssP35cTceU).
