## Our Mission

The internet is increasingly filled with bots, AI-generated content, and algorithmic noise. FairPlay was created to reclaim the human side of creativity — a place where real skills, passions, and stories can thrive.

> “Your passions deserve more than an algorithm.”

FairPlay is currently under development. You'll be introduced to the user interface and some features, but please note that the project is still under development.

This is the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) version of the FairPlay website. It currently includes the landing page. More features will be implemented soon.
